My name is {Name_of_user} , I am from {Nationality_of_user} and I am {age_of_user} years old. I am {character_of_user}. I have always enjoyed watching {sport_of_user} since I was a kid and I decided to take it up. I train for {training_hours} hours every day. I made it to where I am today thanks to hardwork and preseverence. 
  Whenever I am not training for {sport_of_user}, I am usually {hobby_of_user_1} or {hobby_of_user_2}. I like to mix them into my daily life so it is not all about breaking olympic and world records.
